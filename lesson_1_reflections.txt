How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
it helped me see the bug that was introduced by highlighting the areas that are changed in the new file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
having easy access to the entire history of a file makes you a more efficient programmer by letting you to rollback at any previous version without having to redo all you did.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git vs having version automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
the advantage of manually choosing when to create a commit is that it makes sure your commits are compilable. if it were to commit automatically, some there would be too many commits and some might to compile.
On the other hand, if versions automatically save, this makes sure that you don't worry about saving every now and then and avoids the risk of forgetting to save. choosing to manually commit is a risk as you might loose work when something happens just before committing.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because git is for programming where files are interdependent for a program to run.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all the changes made in the repository while git diff compares the changes made between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
version control makes you more confident to introduce negative changes by assuring you that you can always rollback to your old commits

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to do real programming on a project using Git
