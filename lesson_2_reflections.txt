How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the staging area is the area where files to be committed in the repository are placed from the working directory. It enables one to commit only files they want to commit as opposed to committing a whole working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
After every logical change (or after only one logical change has been made in each file), run "git add filename" to stage the file then "git commit -m 'comment'" to commit the change. Then continue to the next logical change (or next already changed file)
